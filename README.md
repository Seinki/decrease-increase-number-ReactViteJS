# React + Vite

# I have tried the react + vite exercise where in the case study, if the "-" button is clicked, it will decrease the number listed in the middle, likewise if the "+" button is clicked, it will increase that number. Then for the reset button, it will repeat the number to zero.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
